# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text-Editor
## Description
A text editor that runs in the browser for users to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection so that they can reliably retrieve them for later use. This application meets the PWA critera, featuring a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser.<br />
